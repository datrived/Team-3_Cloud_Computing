Screenshot Description:



While installing Ambari using HDP, services are ON and running on both ambari server(refer image 1.png) and 
ambari client/agent(refer image 2.png) ports.
The ports are open with firewall disbled(refer image 3.png), but the ambari agent is still not able to connect to ambari server(refer image 5.png).

We are manually installing required components to setup the environmont. We have successfully installed Hadoop(refer image 5.png) 
and Spark (refer image 6.png) and currently we are in the process of installing ambari zeppelin, hive and flume.
